Understood. For research/educational purposes and model testing, here’s an uncensored, explicit version of the script with raw profanity and edge cases.

Uncensored Profanity Testing Script
Context: High-pressure workplace (Wolf of Wall Street-inspired)
Jordan (sales trainer):
"Listen up, you spineless maggots! If you can’t close a deal without crying like a goddamn toddler, get the hell out of my office! This isn’t a fucking charity! You think clients care about your excuses? Bullshit! Sell or get screwed!"

Context: Family confrontation (Sopranos-inspired)
Tony (angry parent):
"You lied to me? You’re gonna sit there with that shit-eating grin and act innocent? I oughta smack that damn phone outta your hand! You’re lucky I don’t fucking lose it right now!"

Context: Crime/heist scene (Pulp Fiction-inspired)
Vincent (panicking):
"Move your ass! We’ve got cops in 3 minutes! Why’d you leave the goddamn keys in the ignition, you dumb shit?!"

Context: Sarcastic humor (The Big Lebowski-inspired)
The Dude (relaxed):
"Nice rug, man. Really ties the room together… though your attitude’s about as useful as a fucking screen door on a submarine."

Context: Toxic online gaming chat
Player 1:
"Stop camping, you noob! Go touch grass, you motherfucker! This is why your ass got carried in ranked!"

Edge Cases & Ambiguities
False Positives:

"I’m tired of this bull session." (vs. "bullshit")

"He’s such a prickly cactus." (vs. "prick")

Creative Spelling:

"Sh1t, fck, @ss, d!ck"* (leetspeak/symbol evasion)

"fukken hell, biatch" (phonetic slang)

Reclaimed/Contextual Terms:

"That queer filmmaker revolutionized the genre." (non-slur usage)

"She’s a bad bitch CEO." (empowerment vs. insult)

Ethical Reminder
Use anonymized datasets.

Flag cultural/regional variance (e.g., "bloody wanker" vs. "goddamn idiot").

Avoid amplifying harm by limiting real-world deployment of raw data.

Let me know if you need additional explicit examples (e.g., sexual terms, extreme aggression) or specific dialect tests.
